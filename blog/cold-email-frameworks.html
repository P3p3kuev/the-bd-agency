<h1>Cold Email Frameworks That Convert</h1>
<p>Cold outreach is noisy. You need structure, clarity, and relevance to cut through. These 3 frameworks consistently deliver meetings at The BD Agency:</p>

<h2>1. Problem → Insight → Action (PIA)</h2>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> "Reps spend 60% of their time chasing bad leads."<br>
<strong>Insight:</strong> "We built a filter engine that prioritizes high-intent prospects."<br>
<strong>Action:</strong> "Worth a quick 10-min breakdown?"</p>

<h2>2. Value Bullets</h2>
<p>"Hi {{FirstName}},<br>
We recently helped:<br>
✔ A SaaS company triple replies<br>
✔ A fintech lower CAC by 28%<br>
✔ A 3-person team exceed $1M in pipeline<br>
Should we take a look together?"</p>

<h2>3. Curiosity Hook</h2>
<p>Start with a bold question:<br>
<strong>“How many demos did your last 1,000 cold emails generate?”</strong><br>
Follow up with a unique insight and ask for a chat.</p>

<p>Track replies. Iterate messaging. Build momentum.<br>
