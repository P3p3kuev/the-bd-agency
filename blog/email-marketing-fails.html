<h1>Why Email Marketing Fails (And How to Fix It)</h1>
<p>Email remains one of the most cost-effective B2B channels. But the majority of campaigns fail to convert. Hereâ€™s whyâ€”and what to do about it.</p>

<h2>Common Pitfalls</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Spray-and-pray lists:</strong> Sending to poorly segmented lists results in low engagement and high bounce rates.</li>
  <li><strong>Weak subject lines:</strong> If it doesnâ€™t earn the open, the rest doesnâ€™t matter. Most teams donâ€™t A/B test enough.</li>
  <li><strong>No clear value:</strong> If your email doesnâ€™t educate, provoke curiosity, or solve a pain pointâ€”itâ€™ll get deleted.</li>
  <li><strong>Too much fluff:</strong> Long, unfocused emails with excessive links and images can trigger spam filters.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Works Instead</h2>
<p>ðŸ”¹ Build clean, segmented lists based on behavior or intent.</p>
<p>ðŸ”¹ Use curiosity-driven subject lines and preview text.</p>
<p>ðŸ”¹ Personalize the first line to show relevance.</p>
<p>ðŸ”¹ Lead with insight, and include a single clear CTA.</p>
<p>ðŸ”¹ Follow up 3â€“5 times. Most replies come after the 2nd or 3rd touch.</p>
