  <h1>Cold Email Frameworks That Convert</h1>
  <p>Use frameworks like PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve) or AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action) to structure your message. Example: "Noticed you're hiring SDRsâ€”struggling to ramp reps? We've helped similar teams reduce ramp time by 40% with our sales enablement toolkit. Worth a quick call next week?" Simple, clear, and value-focused wins every time.</p>
