<h1>Top 5 Lead Gen Tactics That Still Work in 2025</h1>
<p>Technology has changed, but great lead gen still relies on timeless strategies. Here are five tactics that consistently deliver results.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>1. Intent-Based Targeting</strong><br>Use tools that track real-time buyer intent signals and match that to your ICP.</li>
  <li><strong>2. Email + Retargeting</strong><br>Cold email opens the door. Retargeting with warm ads keeps you top-of-mind.</li>
  <li><strong>3. Content Offers</strong><br>Lead magnets like calculators, teardown reports, and cheat sheets build trust and drive opt-ins.</li>
  <li><strong>4. Referral Loops</strong><br>Get your happy customers to refer others. Incentivize it. Track it.</li>
  <li><strong>5. AI-Powered Follow-Up</strong><br>Tools like our AI Caller deliver personalized follow-up at scaleâ€”without lifting a finger.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong> Great messaging and clear positioning will beat any tool stack. Every time.</p>
