  <h1>Why Email Marketing Fails (and How to Fix It)</h1>
  <p>Email marketing often fails due to poor targeting, generic messaging, and a lack of follow-up. Most campaigns are too broad or too pushy. Success comes from personalization, relevant timing, and value-driven messaging. Use merge tags, personalized first lines, and segment your lists. And always A/B test subject lines and CTAs. Consistency and iteration are key.</p>
