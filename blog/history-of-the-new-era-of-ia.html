    <h1>History Of The New Era Of Ia</h1>
    <p>Martín and the New Era of Sales: A Story About AI and Invisible Opportunities
By The BD Agency</p>
<p>Chapter 1: The Traditional Salesman</p>
<p>Martín was good at selling. Very good.</p>
<p>He had that sharp instinct you only earn with years of experience. He knew when to pause, when to push, and when to pull back. He’d learned how to read silences, masked objections, and promises that would never materialize. With a notebook, his CRM, and a coffee in hand, he navigated the B2B world like a seasoned explorer.</p>
<p>But lately, something had changed.</p>
<p>His days were getting longer, his leads went cold faster, and emails were left unanswered. Opportunities were still there—but they moved at a different pace. Faster. More digital. More impersonal.</p>
<p>Martín didn’t know it yet, but he was about to meet a new partner.</p>
<p>Chapter 2: The Arrival of Artificial Intelligence</p>
<p>It didn’t show up as a robot or software with a metallic voice. It came as an automated suggestion in his CRM, an email that wrote itself, an alert that told him which prospect was ready to close.</p>
<p>It was like having an invisible assistant, always one step ahead.</p>
<p>At first, Martín was skeptical. A machine telling him what to do? How could it possibly understand what it took to close a deal? But over time, he noticed something interesting: he was selling more, with less effort.</p>
<p>And not because AI was selling for him.</p>
<p>But because it was setting him free. Helping him prioritize. Focus. Stop wasting time on tasks that didn’t need his talent.</p>
<p>Chapter 3: What AI Can Do</p>
<p>Martín discovered that AI didn’t come to replace him. It came to multiply him.</p>
<p>He learned it could:</p>
<p>Uncover hidden opportunities: By analyzing who visited his site, who opened his emails, and what the data really said.</p>
<p>Send automated emails that felt personal—like he wrote them himself, at just the right time.</p>
<p>Schedule meetings effortlessly, no more endless “does 4 PM work for you?” threads.</p>
<p>Log every interaction—calls, emails, messages—without him lifting a finger.</p>
<p>Suggest precise next steps, based on what had worked before.</p>
<p>All while he focused on what he did best: selling with empathy, listening, solving, closing.</p>
<p>Chapter 4: What AI Can’t (and Shouldn’t) Do</p>
<p>Of course, not everything could be left to the machine.</p>
<p>There were moments where AI simply didn’t fit. Like when a proposal needed to be tailored to a specific need. Or when a closing conversation depended on reading between the lines. Or when a client hesitated—not because of price, but because of fear of change.</p>
<p>Martín realized that AI couldn’t negotiate for him, couldn’t build trust, and couldn’t walk a new client through a complex onboarding process.</p>
<p>That was still human work. Craftsmanship.</p>
<p>And that was just fine.</p>
<p>Chapter 5: The Perfect Fusion</p>
<p>Using AI didn’t make Martín less human. It made him more of a salesperson. More present. Sharper. More focused on what really mattered.</p>
<p>He stopped chasing every single lead, writing endless emails, and filling out CRM fields.
Now, he spent his time building valuable relationships, closing important deals, and designing real solutions for complex clients.</p>
<p>And although his new invisible assistant didn’t drink coffee or close contracts, it reminded him every day how valuable his time truly was.</p>
<p>Epilogue: A New Way to Sell</p>
<p>At The BD Agency, we believe every salesperson can be like Martín.</p>
<p>We believe artificial intelligence isn’t the future—it’s the present. And when used properly, it becomes a natural extension of the sales team.</p>
<p>We help B2B companies integrate AI into their sales processes, without losing what matters most: the human touch.</p>
<p>Because AI doesn’t replace great salespeople.
It simply gives them more time to do what no machine ever could.</p>
<p>Want to Sell Like Martín?</p>
<p>At The BD Agency, we help you build sales processes that are smarter, more efficient, and more human.
